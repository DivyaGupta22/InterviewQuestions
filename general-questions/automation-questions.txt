*********************************

 For successful automation of any sort, it’s important to ensure that tests are isolated: 
 that they do not share any state or affect one another. This is particularly important when writing tests that can run in parallel.
 
 Due to frequent changes in the application within the sprint, we would follow an (n–1) approach to automation of our product, 
 automating the features of the nth sprint in the next sprint, then subsequently using them for regression.
 But due to overload of regression building up as we progressed,
 it was crucial that each tester be able to perform and use the tools effectively, building up the test suites every sprint.
