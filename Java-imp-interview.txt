what is diff b/n abstract class and interface

what is encapsulation and abstraction

what is polymorphism

over loading and overrding differneces

what is inheritance


class level/instance variables are part of heap
method local vars are part of stack and method execeution is done in stack memory
objects are created in heap memoery
both heap and stack are part of system Ram which jvm uses for program executions.

public protected default private
less restrictive ---> more restrictive

Does java support multiple inheritance or multi level inheritance?

A
B extends A
C extends B

why string is immutable in java

how do u make any class immutable - mainly final keyword

what is static- staic means class level- we need not create object to access static fields or methods


what is final- cannot change the value
class final- u cannot extend it
method final- u cannot override
variable is final - u cannot reassign any value

final Encapsulation enc = new Encapsulation();
		enc.setId(1);
		enc.setName("george");
		
above codeobject is not final - refernce var is final- we can still change object data

id java pass by value or pass by refernce
object- copy of refernce is sent with both references pointing to same object
primtive- actual values are sent - so changes are not reflected.

what is diff b/n string, stringbuffer and string builder
eg- when we try to modify existing string a lot in program - we use StringBuffer or builder
always prefer builder if its not multithreaded environment as its faster

file reading- one good example


differnece b/n == and equals method for STring
== compares refrences or memory locations
equals compares actual values

what are kinds of exceptions- how to handle it
checked- filenotfound,io, sqlexception
unchecked- null pointer,arrayoutof 

super class of all exceptions- Throwable- Exception

what is diff b/n final, finally and finalize


what is try/catch/final used for

casting:

Primitive data types casting:
byte , short , int , long , float, double


leftïƒ right upcasting or implicit casting
right->left   downcasting or explicit casting

what is typecasting - explicit and implict cast-- int--float, float to int

what is method to convert string to intger and integer to string


what is autoboxing

what diff collections are present in java

what is diff b/n list, set , map

what is diff b/n arraylist,vector and linkedlist
arrayList is faster for iterationll is fatser for insertion and deletion

what is diff b/n hashmap,hashtable, treemap and linkedhashmap

what is importance of hashcode and equals w.r.to hash collections.

what is diff b/n  hashset, linkedhashset


List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
joe, beena, pal

beena , joe, pal

Collections.sort(list);


List<Employee> list = new ArrayList<Employee>();
joe, beena, pal

beena , joe, pal


Comparable or comapartor - both to define user defined sorting


Employee implements Comparable(){

public int compareTO(Employee o1,Employee o2){
return (e1.name).compareTo(e2.name);

}

}

EmployeeComparator implements Comparator<Employee>(){

public int compareTO(Employee o1,Employee o2){
return (e1.name).compareTo(e2.name);

}

}


Collections.sort(list, new  EmployeeComparator());
